1
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:13,204
A samurai is found dead in a quiet bamboo grove.

2
00:00:13,496 --> 00:00:18,163
One by one, the crime’s only known witnesses recount their version

3
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:20,204
of the events that transpired.

4
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,204
But as they each tell their tale,

5
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:27,621
it becomes clear that every testimony is plausible, yet different.

6
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:30,496
And each witness implicates themselves.

7
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:36,662
This is the premise of “In a Grove,” a short story published in the early 1920s

8
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:39,829
by Japanese author Ryūnosuke Akutagawa.

9
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:44,162
Though many know this tale of warring perspectives by a different name:

10
00:00:44,162 --> 00:00:45,204
“Rashomon.”

11
00:00:45,537 --> 00:00:51,996
In 1950, Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa adapted two of Akutagawa’s stories

12
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:53,162
into one film.

13
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:57,787
This movie introduced the world to an enduring cultural metaphor

14
00:00:57,787 --> 00:01:03,204
that has transformed our understanding of truth, justice and human memory.

15
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:08,829
The Rashomon effect describes a situation

16
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:13,829
in which individuals give significantly different but equally conceivable accounts

17
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:15,246
of the same event.

18
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:19,704
Often used to highlight the unreliability of eyewitnesses,

19
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:23,621
the Rashomon effect usually occurs under two specific conditions.

20
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,079
The first: there’s no evidence to verify what really happened.

21
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,329
And the second: there’s pressure to achieve closure,

22
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:36,329
often provided by an authority figure trying to identify the definitive truth.

23
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:41,829
But the Rashomon effect undermines the very idea of a singular, objective truth.

24
00:01:43,163 --> 00:01:44,663
In the source material,

25
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:48,121
Akutagawa and Kurosawa use the tools of their media

26
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:51,163
to give each character’s testimony equal weight,

27
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:55,121
transforming each witness into an unreliable narrator.

28
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:58,579
Without any hints on who’s sharing the most accurate account,

29
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:02,038
the audience can’t tell which character to trust.

30
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:05,954
Instead, each testimony takes on a truthful quality,

31
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:08,663
and the audience is left doubting their convictions

32
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:11,121
as they guess who ended the samurai’s life.

33
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:15,913
Some might find this frustrating because the plot subverts expectations

34
00:02:15,913 --> 00:02:18,121
of how mysteries usually end.

35
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:20,996
But by refusing to provide a clear answer,

36
00:02:20,996 --> 00:02:26,621
these two artists capture the messiness and complexity of truth and human memory.

37
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:30,371
Neuroscientists have found that when we form a memory,

38
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:33,329
our interpretation of visual information is influenced

39
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:36,704
by our previous experiences and internal biases.

40
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:40,413
Some of these biases are unique to individuals,

41
00:02:40,413 --> 00:02:42,204
but others are more universal.

42
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,704
For example, egocentric bias can influence people

43
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:48,038
to subconsciously reshape their memories

44
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:51,621
in ways that cast a positive light on their actions.

45
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:54,663
Even if we were able to encode a memory accurately,

46
00:02:54,663 --> 00:02:58,579
recalling it incorporates new information that changes the memory.

47
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:00,954
And when we later recall that event,

48
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:05,954
we typically remember the embellished memory instead of the original experience.

49
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:10,871
These underlying psychological phenomena mean that the Rashomon effect

50
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,371
can pop up anywhere.

51
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:15,829
In biology, scientists starting from the same dataset

52
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:20,579
and applying the same analytical methods, frequently publish different results.

53
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:25,371
Anthropologists regularly grapple with the impact personal backgrounds can have

54
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,954
on an expert's perception.

55
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:32,454
In one famous case, two anthropologists visited the Mexican village of Tepoztlan.

56
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,913
The first researcher described life in the town as happy and contented,

57
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:40,954
while the second recorded residents as paranoid and disgruntled.

58
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:46,329
Experts aside, the Rashomon effect can also impact the general public,

59
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:50,121
particularly when it comes to the perception of complicated world events.

60
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:54,621
For example, following a 2015 security summit

61
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:57,913
between the United States and leaders from the Arab States,

62
00:03:57,913 --> 00:04:01,121
media reports about the summit varied enormously.

63
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:06,454
Some stated that it had gone smoothly, while others called it a complete failure.

64
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:11,413
It's tempting to fixate on why we have competing perceptions,

65
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:15,621
but perhaps the more important question the Rashomon effect raises is,

66
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,288
what is truth anyway?

67
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:21,246
Are there situations when an “objective truth” doesn’t exist?

68
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:24,954
What can different versions of the same event tell us

69
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:27,913
about the time, place and people involved?

70
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:31,746
And how can we make group decisions if we’re all working

71
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:35,163
with different information, backgrounds, and biases?

72
00:04:36,663 --> 00:04:41,163
Like most questions, these don’t have a definitive answer.

73
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:45,079
But the enduring importance of Akutagawa’s story

74
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,663
suggests there may be value in embracing the ambiguity.
