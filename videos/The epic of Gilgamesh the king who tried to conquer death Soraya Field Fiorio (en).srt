00:00:06,913 --> 00:00:11,746
In 1849, in the ancient city of Nineveh in northern Iraq,

2
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:15,621
archaeologists sifted through dusty remains,

3
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:19,871
hoping to find records to prove that Bible stories were true.

4
00:00:20,163 --> 00:00:24,496
What they found instead was one of the oldest libraries in the world.

5
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:30,538
Inscribed on crumbling clay tablets was a 4,000-year-old story

6
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:36,454
so riveting the first person to translate it started stripping from excitement.

7
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,954
Called the epic of Gilgamesh,

8
00:00:39,954 --> 00:00:44,496
the story starts with Gilgamesh, king of the city of Uruk,

9
00:00:44,496 --> 00:00:47,912
crashing every wedding and sleeping with the bride

10
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:50,787
before she has a chance to sleep with her husband.

11
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:57,787
To tame Gilgamesh, the goddess Aruru created a rival called Enkidu.

12
00:00:57,787 --> 00:01:00,329
Enkidu lived beyond the walls of the city,

13
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:06,121
where chaos reigned and wild animals, invaders, and evil spirits prowled.

14
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:11,079
After a priestess of the goddess Ishtar seduced Enkidu,

15
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:16,454
the wild animals beyond the wall rejected him and he ventured into the city.

16
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:20,996
There, he encountered Gilgamesh up to his usual tricks.

17
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:23,496
Enkidu stepped in to stop him.

18
00:01:24,496 --> 00:01:29,621
Almost perfectly matched, the two men wrestled all through the city streets

19
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:32,413
until Gilgamesh won the fight by a hair.

20
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:35,329
Afterwards, they were inseparable.

21
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:40,413
With his new friend, Gilgamesh turned his attention from the brides of Uruk

22
00:01:40,788 --> 00:01:43,079
to proving his strength in combat.

23
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:45,913
They set out to slay Humbaba,

24
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:51,496
a creature with a thousand faces who guarded the trees of the Forest of Cedar.

25
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:55,246
They tracked Humbaba and ambushed him.

26
00:01:55,246 --> 00:01:57,663
Cornered, he begged for his life,

27
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:01,871
then cursed them as Gilgamesh dealt the final blow.

28
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:08,496
Back home in Uruk, the goddess Ishtar took a romantic interest in Gilgamesh.

29
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:12,829
Knowing she tended to lose interest and curse her former flames,

30
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:15,996
Gilgamesh refused her advances.

31
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:22,663
So Ishtar unleashed the Bull of Heaven on Uruk to destroy crops and kill people.

32
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:26,704
When Gilgamesh and Enkidu slayed the creature defending the city,

33
00:02:27,788 --> 00:02:30,621
the gods killed Enkidu.

34
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:33,246
He entered the House of Dust,

35
00:02:33,788 --> 00:02:38,121
the shadowy Mesopotamian underworld where the spirits of the dead

36
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:43,163
knelt eternally on the ground, eating dirt and drinking stone.

37
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,371
Grieving for Enkidu and terrified of meeting this fate himself,

38
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:53,371
Gilgamesh set off beyond the cosmic mountains to seek immortality.

39
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:57,954
He passed scorpion people and groves of gemstone trees,

40
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:02,163
travelled beneath the mountains and outran the rising sun,

41
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:06,538
until he finally came to the end of the world,

42
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:08,413
where he found a bar.

43
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:11,829
The bartender was a goddess named Shiduri,

44
00:03:12,788 --> 00:03:15,871
who urged Gilgamesh to give up his quest.

45
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:19,038
She told him all mortals must die,

46
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:23,621
but until death comes, he should enjoy his life.

47
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:26,329
But Gilgamesh refused to give up.

48
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:31,163
Reluctantly, Shiduri gave him directions to cross the Waters of Death

49
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:34,079
and meet the immortal man Utanapishti.

50
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:39,663
The gods had granted Utanapishti immortality following a great flood,

51
00:03:39,663 --> 00:03:41,454
during which he built a boat,

52
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:46,288
loaded two of every animal onto it, and landed on a mountain peak.

53
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:53,079
Utanapishti also encouraged Gilgamesh to accept that death comes for everyone.

54
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,454
But Gilgamesh still would not budge.

55
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,496
So Utanapishti told him that if he could conquer sleep,

56
00:03:59,496 --> 00:04:02,329
the gods might grant him immortality.

57
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:05,496
Gilgamesh intended to stay awake for seven days,

58
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,329
but fell asleep immediately.

59
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:14,204
Utanapishti then told him about a magical plant that grew at the bottom of the ocean

60
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:16,371
and granted eternal youth.

61
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:19,871
Though Gilgamesh successfully retrieved the plant,

62
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:22,496
a snake stole it on his way home.

63
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,371
But when Gilgamesh laid eyes on his beautiful city again,

64
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:33,413
he made peace with his mortality and vowed to spend his lifetime doing great deeds.

65
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:37,746
He wrote his story on a lapis lazuli tablet

66
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:43,454
and buried it under the city walls for future generations to find and learn from.

67
00:04:43,954 --> 00:04:45,538
The tablets uncovered in Nineveh

68
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:49,871
were part of the library of the Assyrian king, Ashurbanipal.

69
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:55,913
Though the story is mythical, Gilgamesh was probably a real king of Uruk.

70
00:04:55,913 --> 00:05:02,288
Versions of his tale date to 2000 BCE and perhaps even longer ago,

71
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:05,204
and still echo through literature today.
