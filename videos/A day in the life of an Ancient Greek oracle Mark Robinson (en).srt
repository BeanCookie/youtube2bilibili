1
00:00:08,746 --> 00:00:13,329
As the sun rises over Delphi in 500 BCE,

2
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:16,413
Aristonike hurries to the temple of Apollo.

3
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:20,371
Like all Greeks, she's known the legend of Delphi since childhood.

4
00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:26,538
Two eagles released by Zeus from opposite ends of the Earth

5
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:29,121
met on the slopes of Mount Parnassus,

6
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:31,913
identifying Delphi as the center of the world.

7
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:37,704
Marking this spot was a mysterious stone guarded by a legendary serpent

8
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,079
called the pytho.

9
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:43,037
But when Apollo killed the pytho, he made Delphi his home—

10
00:00:43,037 --> 00:00:46,162
establishing the city as the best place in the world

11
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:50,121
to seek guidance directly from the God of Prophecy.

12
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:52,621
Well, almost directly.

13
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:58,787
At any given time, a single oracle known as the Pythia communicates Apollo’s will.

14
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:03,329
Reserved only for women, this is the most important job in the city—

15
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,954
and one that Aristonike will soon have to take on as the current Pythia-in-training.

16
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:12,496
Despite serving in the Temple of Apollo for many years,

17
00:01:12,496 --> 00:01:17,329
Aristonike is still uncertain that she’s wise enough to fulfill this role.

18
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:19,913
But these doubts will have to wait.

19
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,746
Today she’ll be shadowed by officials from the city’s governing council.

20
00:01:23,788 --> 00:01:26,163
If her performance meets their standards,

21
00:01:26,163 --> 00:01:29,579
this is the day she’ll become the new Oracle of Delphi.

22
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,579
In the heart of the temenos, or sacred enclosure,

23
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:37,829
Aristonike greets the current Oracle and the city officials.

24
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,288
The group joins the procession to the Castilian Spring,

25
00:01:41,288 --> 00:01:44,329
where the Pythia performs a purification ceremony

26
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:46,246
to prepare for a day of prophecy.

27
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:50,204
To establish whether Apollo is willing to be consulted,

28
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:54,204
Aristonike brings water from the spring to the temple priests,

29
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:56,121
who sprinkle it on a goat.

30
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:59,371
If the goat shudders, it will be a prophecy day.

31
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:05,579
If not, travelers from as far away as modern day Sicily, Egypt, and Afghanistan

32
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,163
will have to wait an entire month to consult the Oracle again.

33
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:14,079
Fortunately, Apollo is in a communicative mood.

34
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:19,204
Delphians are first in line, most seeking advice about business or marriage.

35
00:02:20,788 --> 00:02:24,996
Following the locals are other Greeks and then non-Greeks,

36
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:28,954
including ambassadors from great cities who plan to ask

37
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:33,829
about whether to go to war, or where they should found new colonies.

38
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:38,079
Most supplicants bring two options for the Pythia to choose between,

39
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:41,246
alongside the obligatory sacrificial cake.

40
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,621
Aristonike reports back to the Pythia,

41
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:48,579
pointing out important figures and sharing some of their concerns—

42
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:51,829
all while the city counselor takes notes on her performance.

43
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:57,246
Then the Pythia disappears into her oracular chamber known as the adyton.

44
00:02:57,538 --> 00:03:01,038
Inside, she’ll channel the inspiration of Apollo,

45
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:05,329
uttering ambiguous prophecies the questioners must interpret.

46
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:11,371
The adyton is the one place in the temple Aristonike isn’t allowed to go.

47
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:13,246
So while consultations continue,

48
00:03:13,246 --> 00:03:18,579
the Oracle-in-training sets off to collect wood for the temple’s eternal flame.

49
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:21,788
While gathering branches from the sacred laurel trees,

50
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:26,788
Aristonike spies wealthy Greeks training for the upcoming Pythian Games.

51
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:30,079
Second in importance only to the Olympics,

52
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:33,413
these games bring great riches and attention to Delphi.

53
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:37,413
Typically, Aristonike would pause to admire the athletes,

54
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:40,788
but today she’s more focused on impressing her observer.

55
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:43,621
Taking the exact amount of branches necessary,

56
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:47,621
she hurries back to the temple for her long awaited evaluation.

57
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:52,079
The counselor who shadowed her shares his notes with the other officials,

58
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,163
and after a brief discussion, their leader nods.

59
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:58,496
He endorses Aristonike as the new Oracle—

60
00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:02,163
and the Pythia offers Apollo’s blessing on their verdict.

61
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,954
Approaching Aristonike beside the sacred hearth,

62
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,371
the Pythia finally unveils the secrets of her trade.

63
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:12,746
Passed directly from one Oracle to the next,

64
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:16,204
no history book will ever record these details.

65
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:21,163
But the Pythia’s insights will guide all of Aristonike’s future prophecies—

66
00:04:21,163 --> 00:04:25,538
shaping wars, politics, and relationships for years to come,

67
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:30,288
and making Aristonike one of the most powerful women in the ancient world.

68
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:33,163
As the Pythia concludes her final lesson,

69
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:36,621
she points to two inscriptions on the temple walls:

70
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:39,829
“know yourself” and “nothing in excess.”

71
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,663
Left alone to ponder these ideas,

72
00:04:42,663 --> 00:04:46,496
Aristonike feels the first touch of Apollo’s inspiration—

73
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:50,704
the insight that keeping an open mind may be more important

74
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:52,663
than finding a single answer.
