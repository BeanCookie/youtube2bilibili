1
00:00:07,246 --> 00:00:10,663
We have lots in common with our closest primate relatives.

2
00:00:10,663 --> 00:00:14,704
But comparatively, humans seem a bit... underdressed.

3
00:00:14,704 --> 00:00:17,454
Instead of thick fur covering our bodies,

4
00:00:17,454 --> 00:00:20,204
many of us mainly have hair on top of our heads—

5
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:21,621
and a few other places.

6
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:26,704
So, how did we get so naked? And why do we have hair where we do?

7
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:30,454
Human hair and animal fur are made of the same stuff:

8
00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:34,746
filaments of the protein keratin that grow out of organs known as follicles,

9
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:37,246
which go through cycles of growth and shedding.

10
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,954
Across mammalian species, hairs have been modified for numerous purposes,

11
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:44,662
ranging from the soft fluff covering rabbits

12
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:47,287
to the rigid quills protecting porcupines.

13
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,287
But for many mammals, hair grows in two layers

14
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:53,579
consisting of a shorter undercoat of ground hairs

15
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,829
covered by longer guard hairs.

16
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,204
Together, they help insulate the animal’s body and protect its skin.

17
00:01:00,746 --> 00:01:05,079
Human hairs, on the other hand, are kind of a combination of these hair types.

18
00:01:05,704 --> 00:01:08,871
Unfortunately, hair is rarely found in fossils,

19
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:11,746
making it hard for researchers to pinpoint when and how

20
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:13,954
our ancient ancestors lost their coats.

21
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:17,788
But scientists have developed some working hypotheses.

22
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:21,371
It seems that, millions of years ago in Africa,

23
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:26,329
early hominins first transitioned out of trees and adopted a more active lifestyle.

24
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:29,621
Keeping cool became increasingly important.

25
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:32,996
Eventually, they developed more sweat glands,

26
00:01:32,996 --> 00:01:36,413
which helped them lose heat by evaporating moisture through the skin.

27
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:41,288
In fact, humans have 10 times more sweat glands than chimpanzees, for instance.

28
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:46,329
But efficiently losing heat by sweating is harder to do when you’re covered in fur.

29
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:50,746
Scientists believe that early humans lost much of their coat around this time

30
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:53,038
to help their sweat evaporate faster.

31
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:56,246
However, if losing our hair was so advantageous,

32
00:01:56,246 --> 00:01:58,121
why do we have any left at all?

33
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:02,496
It seems that there are unique uses for hair in different parts of our bodies.

34
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:05,329
When it comes to the tops of our heads,

35
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,996
temperature regulation likely played a part again.

36
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:10,871
Since early humans began venturing into the open,

37
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:14,038
their heads would’ve been exposed to the scorching sun.

38
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:17,704
Thicker, longer-growing hair protects our sensitive scalps

39
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,038
and keeps our brains from overheating.

40
00:02:20,538 --> 00:02:25,621
Dark tightly curled hair is most effective at keeping solar radiation off of skin.

41
00:02:25,871 --> 00:02:30,288
Other kinds of head hair evolved as humans moved to different places.

42
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:34,871
Meanwhile, researchers think eyebrows are especially useful for communication

43
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:38,579
because they sit atop active facial muscles that convey our feelings.

44
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:42,829
Eyelashes have been shown to minimize airflow over our eyeballs,

45
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,788
preventing them from drying out and catching debris.

46
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:50,871
And maybe facial hair proved helpful in distinguishing identity from a distance,

47
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,371
but we really don’t know.

48
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:54,829
Evidence is stubbly at best.

49
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:59,746
Why we have hair in other regions is... more pungent.

50
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:04,579
Our armpits, nipples, and pubic areas are dotted with apocrine glands.

51
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:07,954
They produce oily, smelly secretions which the thick, curly hair

52
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,788
that often grows in these spots helps disperse.

53
00:03:11,246 --> 00:03:16,371
The secretions that waft off these hairy patches may be useful for identification.

54
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:20,954
For example, several studies have shown that people are able to identify

55
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:25,496
their own armpit odors as well as those of people they’re close with.

56
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:30,913
The final type of notable human hair is the vellus hair that covers our bodies.

57
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:34,079
We don't know if these hairs serve any purpose themselves,

58
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:38,663
but the follicles vellus hair grows from are essential banks of stem cells

59
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:41,204
that repair damaged skin after injury.

60
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:45,288
They’re also important sites of nerve endings that convey signals

61
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:47,288
of gentle touch to the brain.

62
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:49,496
In fact, although it’s much finer,

63
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:54,246
humans have roughly the same density of body hair as apes of comparable sizes.

64
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:57,746
So despite all this talk of human nakedness,

65
00:03:57,746 --> 00:04:00,829
we're not actually as hairless as we look.
