1
00:00:10,704 --> 00:00:12,829
After 12 years living in California,

2
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:16,913
Chinese citizen Chae Chan Ping was ready for a visit home.

3
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:21,371
He procured the necessary documents for his departure and return journey,

4
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:22,996
and set sail for China,

5
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:26,579
where he spent the next year reconnecting with friends and family.

6
00:00:27,163 --> 00:00:31,579
But when he returned to San Francisco on October 8th, 1888,

7
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:35,329
Ping and his fellow immigrant passengers were forbidden to disembark.

8
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:41,204
Just days earlier, President Grover Cleveland had signed the Scott Act,

9
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:44,621
which invalidated the legal documents allowing their re-entry

10
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:46,121
to the United States.

11
00:00:46,204 --> 00:00:48,871
This policy threatened to separate families

12
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:52,537
and deprive Chinese immigrants of their homes and livelihoods.

13
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:54,871
Ping challenged the ruling,

14
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:59,037
beginning a legal battle for the rights of thousands of Chinese immigrants.

15
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:03,287
But his case inspired an even more controversial policy

16
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:07,121
that continues to impact immigrants around the globe.

17
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:11,621
Discrimination against Chinese immigrants had begun decades earlier,

18
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:15,579
when the California Gold Rush created a massive demand for labor.

19
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:19,496
Initially, Chinese immigrants were welcomed as reliable workers

20
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,788
and became essential parts of frontier communities.

21
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:25,621
Many built railroads and worked in the mines,

22
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:29,579
while others operated laundries, restaurants, and general stores.

23
00:01:29,913 --> 00:01:36,288
The 1868 Burlingame Treaty even granted China favored trading status with the US,

24
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:40,246
and allowed unrestricted migration between the two countries.

25
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:46,329
But as large numbers of Chinese immigrants found success,

26
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:49,163
American workers began to see them as a threat.

27
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:54,079
Politicians and labor leaders denounced them for driving down wages,

28
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,871
and violence against Chinese individuals became increasingly common.

29
00:01:58,163 --> 00:02:02,996
This anti-Chinese sentiment soon found its way into California’s courts.

30
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,204
In 1854, following a murder trial where a white man was convicted

31
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:09,329
of murdering a Chinese man,

32
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:13,079
the California Supreme Court overturned the conviction,

33
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:16,954
holding that Chinese eyewitness testimony was inadmissible.

34
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,371
The court declared that Chinese citizens

35
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:22,246
could not testify against white defendants,

36
00:02:22,246 --> 00:02:24,829
citing similar precedents forbidding testimony

37
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:27,496
by Black and Native American individuals.

38
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:31,079
This decision effectively legalized violence

39
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,954
against California’s Chinese population,

40
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:37,704
inspiring mob attacks and campaigns for segregation.

41
00:02:38,246 --> 00:02:41,996
Before long, anti-Chinese sentiment reached the federal level.

42
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:46,329
In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act,

43
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:49,413
the first federal law that restricted immigration

44
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:51,829
based explicitly on nationality.

45
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:56,329
In practice, the Act banned entry to all ethnically Chinese immigrants

46
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:57,621
besides diplomats,

47
00:02:57,621 --> 00:03:00,913
and prohibited existing immigrants from obtaining citizenship.

48
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:05,538
It also meant Chinese individuals couldn’t leave the United States and return

49
00:03:05,538 --> 00:03:08,663
without first applying for a certificate of re-entry.

50
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:13,038
This policy remained in place until October 1st, 1888,

51
00:03:13,038 --> 00:03:16,246
when the Scott Act prohibited re-entry altogether,

52
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:20,579
stranding Chae Chan Ping and thousands of other Chinese immigrants.

53
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:25,579
In court, Ping argued he had followed the proper protocol

54
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,663
obtaining his re-entry certificate,

55
00:03:27,663 --> 00:03:31,496
and the government had not honored his legally issued document.

56
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:36,788
This argument was strong enough to send his case all the way to the Supreme Court.

57
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:39,454
But the justices ruled against Ping,

58
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:44,746
invalidating thousands of legal re-entry certificates in one fell swoop.

59
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,996
The decision led to Ping’s deportation

60
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:53,913
and left up to 20,000 Chinese immigrants unable to return to the US.

61
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,454
But arguably even more important than the court’s racist ruling

62
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:00,871
was the logic they used to support it.

63
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:04,038
Traditionally, the Supreme Court is considered a check

64
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:06,746
on the other two branches of American government,

65
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,996
offering judgment on policies passed by Congress and the president.

66
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:13,163
In this case however,

67
00:04:13,163 --> 00:04:17,746
the court stated they had no power to pass judgment on the Scott Act,

68
00:04:17,746 --> 00:04:20,538
since Congress had declared the immigration policy

69
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:22,996
“a matter of national security.”

70
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:25,996
This decision set a unique precedent.

71
00:04:26,204 --> 00:04:28,454
Unless Ping's case was overturned,

72
00:04:28,454 --> 00:04:33,163
congressional and executive branches could claim national security concerns

73
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:36,496
to pass whatever immigration laws they wanted.

74
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,204
Throughout the 20th century,

75
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:43,413
xenophobic government officials used this power to freely discriminate

76
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:45,163
against immigrant groups.

77
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:51,621
The 1917 Asiatic Barred Zone Act prohibited the entry of all South Asians.

78
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:54,663
And a series of immigration acts in the 1920s

79
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:59,121
expanded restrictions throughout Asia, Eastern Europe and southern Europe.

80
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:02,371
Many of these restrictions were lifted after World War II,

81
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:07,329
and the Chinese Exclusion Act itself was finally repealed in 1943—

82
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:10,288
over 60 years after it was enacted.

83
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:13,496
But the US government continues to use this precedent

84
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:16,704
to deploy sudden and sweeping immigration policies,

85
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:21,121
targeting journalists and dissidents as well as ethnic groups.

86
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:26,788
Little is known about what became of Chae Chan Ping following his deportation.

87
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:32,038
But the injustices visited upon him and thousands of other Chinese Americans

88
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:35,579
continue to impact immigrant rights and liberties.
