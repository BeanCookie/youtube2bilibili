1
00:00:08,163 --> 00:00:11,954
In the 1930s, the United States was ravaged by syphilis.

2
00:00:11,954 --> 00:00:15,871
This sexually transmitted infection afflicted nearly 1 in 10 Americans,

3
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:20,538
producing painful sores and rashes that persisted for roughly two years.

4
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:25,621
After these initial symptoms, late-stage syphilis was known to cause organ damage,

5
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:28,121
heart and brain disorders, and even blindness.

6
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:31,538
It was incredibly difficult to slow the disease’s spread.

7
00:00:32,037 --> 00:00:35,246
Experts cautioned against unprotected sex,

8
00:00:35,246 --> 00:00:37,954
but the infection could also be passed during childbirth.

9
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:42,704
Worse still, existing treatments like mercury and bismuth

10
00:00:42,787 --> 00:00:47,287
were considered unreliable at best and potentially harmful at worst.

11
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:51,162
Today these heavy metals are classified as toxic,

12
00:00:51,162 --> 00:00:55,287
but at the time, doctors were still uncovering their dangerous side effects.

13
00:00:55,912 --> 00:00:59,954
Amidst the uncertainty, health care professionals had two key questions.

14
00:01:00,246 --> 00:01:04,038
Did late-stage syphilis warrant the risks of existing treatments?

15
00:01:04,038 --> 00:01:08,121
And, did the infected individual’s race change how the disease progressed?

16
00:01:08,496 --> 00:01:11,079
Many physicians were convinced syphilis affected

17
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,413
the neurological systems of white patients

18
00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:15,954
and the cardiovascular systems of Black patients.

19
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:18,579
There was little evidence for this theory,

20
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:22,288
but the U.S. Public Health Service was determined to investigate further.

21
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:27,329
In 1932 they launched a massive experiment in Tuskegee, Alabama.

22
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,204
The town had already possessed a small hospital,

23
00:01:30,204 --> 00:01:33,788
and the area was home to a large population of potential participants.

24
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:37,663
The PHS collaborated with local doctors and nurses

25
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:43,246
to recruit roughly 400 Black men presumed to have noncontagious late-stage syphilis,

26
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:47,746
as well as 200 non-syphilitic Black men for their control group.

27
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:50,788
But their recruitment plan centered on a lie.

28
00:01:50,788 --> 00:01:53,329
While the researchers planned to observe how syphilis

29
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:55,204
would progress with minimal treatment,

30
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:59,288
participants were told they would receive free drugs and care for their condition.

31
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:03,538
At first, researchers gave the men existing treatments,

32
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:05,913
but these were soon replaced with placebos.

33
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:09,204
Under the false pretense of providing a special remedy,

34
00:02:09,204 --> 00:02:12,663
researchers performed painful and invasive spinal taps

35
00:02:12,663 --> 00:02:15,329
to investigate the disease’s neurological consequences.

36
00:02:15,788 --> 00:02:19,788
When patients died, the PHS would swoop in to study the body

37
00:02:19,788 --> 00:02:22,454
by funding funerals in exchange for autopsies.

38
00:02:23,038 --> 00:02:26,496
In their published studies, they listed the men as volunteers

39
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:29,663
to obscure the circumstances under which they’d been recruited.

40
00:02:30,204 --> 00:02:33,371
Outside Alabama, syphilis treatment was advancing.

41
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:35,496
A decade after the study began,

42
00:02:35,496 --> 00:02:38,954
clinical trials confirmed that penicillin effectively cured the disease

43
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:40,329
in its early stages.

44
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:43,871
But in Tuskegee, researchers were determined to keep pursuing

45
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:45,996
what they considered vital research.

46
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:49,371
They had yet to confirm their theories about racial difference,

47
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:52,163
and they believed they would never have another opportunity

48
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:54,871
to observe the long-term effects of untreated syphilis.

49
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:58,538
The study’s leadership decided to withhold knowledge of new treatments

50
00:02:58,538 --> 00:02:59,621
from their subjects.

51
00:02:59,954 --> 00:03:03,538
During World War II, researchers convinced the local draft board

52
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:05,413
to exempt men from their study,

53
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:08,746
preventing them from enlisting and potentially accessing penicillin.

54
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:11,704
The study even continued through the 1950s

55
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:15,038
when penicillin was shown to help manage late-stage syphilis.

56
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:17,704
By today’s bioethical standards,

57
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:21,621
withholding treatment in a research study without a patient’s informed consent

58
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:22,954
is morally abhorrent.

59
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:27,246
But for a large part of the 20th century, this practice was not uncommon.

60
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:31,579
In the 1940s, US led studies in Guatemala infected

61
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:35,913
numerous prisoners, sex workers, soldiers, and mental health patients

62
00:03:35,913 --> 00:03:39,454
with sexually transmitted infections to study potential treatments.

63
00:03:40,038 --> 00:03:42,788
And other studies throughout the 50s and 60s

64
00:03:42,788 --> 00:03:47,704
saw doctors secretly infecting patients with viral hepatitis or even cancer cells.

65
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:52,204
Eventually, researchers began objecting to these unjust experiments.

66
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:56,913
In the late 1960s, an STI contact tracer named Peter Buxtun

67
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:59,829
convinced the PHS to consider ending the study.

68
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:04,538
But after leadership decided against it, Buxtun sent his concerns to the press.

69
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:10,621
In July of 1972, an exposé of the Tuskegee study made headlines across the country.

70
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:15,871
Following public outcry, a federal investigation, and a lawsuit,

71
00:04:15,913 --> 00:04:21,204
the study was finally shut down in 1972— 40 years after it began

72
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:24,204
and 30 after a treatment for syphilis had been found.

73
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:27,454
No evidence of any racial difference was discovered.

74
00:04:28,246 --> 00:04:32,788
When the study ended, only 74 of the original 600 men were alive.

75
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:37,288
40 of their wives and 19 of their children had contracted syphilis,

76
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:39,913
presumably from their husbands and fathers.

77
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:43,454
In the wake of this tragedy, and concerns about similar experiments,

78
00:04:43,454 --> 00:04:47,454
Congress passed new regulations for ethical research and informed consent.

79
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,246
But systemic racism continues to permeate medical care and research

80
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:52,496
throughout the US.

81
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:54,454
To truly address these issues,

82
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:57,496
the need for structural change, better access to care,

83
00:04:57,496 --> 00:05:00,329
and transparency in research remains urgent.
