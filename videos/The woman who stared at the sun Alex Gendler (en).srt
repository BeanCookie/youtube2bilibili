1
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:12,508
In the spring of 1944, Tokyo residents experienced numerous aerial attacks

2
00:00:12,508 --> 00:00:14,135
from Allied bombers.

3
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:17,430
Air raid sirens warned citizens to get indoors

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,808
and preceded strategic blackouts across the city.

5
00:00:21,392 --> 00:00:26,522
But 28-year old Hisako Koyama saw these blackouts as opportunities.

6
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:29,817
Dragging a futon over her head for protection,

7
00:00:29,817 --> 00:00:32,195
Koyama would gaze at the night sky,

8
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:35,156
tracking all sorts of astronomical phenomena.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,786
However, her latest endeavor required the light of day.

10
00:00:39,786 --> 00:00:42,872
By angling her telescope towards the sun,

11
00:00:42,872 --> 00:00:46,959
Koyama could project the star's light onto a sheet of paper,

12
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:50,505
allowing her to sketch the sun’s shifting surface.

13
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:56,302
She spent weeks recreating this set up, tracking every change she saw.

14
00:00:56,302 --> 00:00:58,262
But while Koyama didn't know it,

15
00:00:58,262 --> 00:01:01,974
these drawings were the start of one of the most important records

16
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:04,727
of solar activity in human history.

17
00:01:05,353 --> 00:01:09,482
To understand exactly what Koyama saw on the sun’s surface,

18
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:13,361
we first need to understand what’s happening inside the star.

19
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:16,489
Every second, trillions of hydrogen atoms

20
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:21,327
fuse into helium atoms in a process called nuclear fusion.

21
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:26,207
This ongoing explosion maintains the sun’s internal temperature

22
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:29,335
of roughly 15 million degrees Celsius,

23
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:32,713
which is more than enough energy to transform gas

24
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:35,716
into churning pools of plasma.

25
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:41,722
Plasma consists of charged particles that produce powerful magnetic fields.

26
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:47,103
But unlike the stable charged particles that maintain magnetic activity on Earth,

27
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:50,189
this plasma is constantly in flux,

28
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,402
alternately disrupting and amplifying the sun's magnetic field.

29
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,029
This ongoing movement can produce

30
00:01:57,029 --> 00:02:00,074
temporary concentrations of magnetic activity

31
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:05,079
which inhibit the movement of molecules and in turn reduce heat in that area.

32
00:02:05,413 --> 00:02:08,708
And since regions with less heat generate less light,

33
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:13,129
places with the strongest magnetic fields appear as dark spots

34
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:15,256
scattered across the sun’s surface.

35
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:19,093
These so-called sunspots are always moving,

36
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:22,513
both as a result of plasma swirling within the sphere,

37
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:24,390
and the sun’s rotation.

38
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:27,518
And because they’re often clustered together,

39
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:32,106
accurately counting sunspots and tracking their movement can be a challenge,

40
00:02:32,106 --> 00:02:35,735
depending greatly on the perception and judgment of the viewer.

41
00:02:36,152 --> 00:02:40,406
This is precisely where Koyama’s contributions would be so valuable.

42
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:43,659
Despite having no formal training in astronomy,

43
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:47,205
her observations and sketches were remarkably accurate.

44
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:51,584
After sending her work to the Oriental Astronomical Association,

45
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:56,547
she received a letter of commendation for her dedicated and detailed observations.

46
00:02:56,964 --> 00:03:01,177
With their support, she began to visit the Tokyo Museum of Science,

47
00:03:01,177 --> 00:03:05,306
where she could use a far superior telescope to continue her work.

48
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,936
Koyama soon joined the museum's staff as a professional observer,

49
00:03:10,436 --> 00:03:13,940
and over the next 40 years, she worked on a daily basis,

50
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,568
producing over 10,000 drawings of the sun’s surface.

51
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:23,658
Researchers already knew magnetic currents in the sun followed an 11 year cycle

52
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:28,621
that moved sunspots in a butterfly shaped path over the star’s surface.

53
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:30,665
But using Koyama’s record,

54
00:03:30,665 --> 00:03:34,794
they could precisely follow specific sunspots and clusters

55
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:36,128
through that journey.

56
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:41,509
This kind of detail offered a real-time indication of the sun’s magnetic activity,

57
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:45,096
allowing scientists to track all kinds of solar phenomena,

58
00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:48,099
including volatile solar flares.

59
00:03:48,516 --> 00:03:52,645
These flares typically emanate from the vicinity of sunspots,

60
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:55,856
and can travel all the way to Earth’s atmosphere.

61
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:58,818
Here, they can create geomagnetic storms

62
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:03,072
capable of disrupting long range communication and causing blackouts.

63
00:04:03,322 --> 00:04:08,577
Solar flares also pose a major risk to satellites and manned space stations,

64
00:04:08,744 --> 00:04:11,455
making them essential to predict and plan for.

65
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:14,458
During an interview in 1964,

66
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:19,130
Koyama lamented that her 17 years of observation had barely been enough

67
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,675
to produce a single butterfly record of the solar cycle.

68
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,471
But by the end of her career, she’d drawn three and a half cycles—

69
00:04:27,471 --> 00:04:29,598
one of the longest records ever made.

70
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:34,103
Better still, the quality of her drawings was so consistent,

71
00:04:34,103 --> 00:04:39,066
researchers used them as a baseline to reconstruct the past 400 years

72
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:42,486
of sunspot activity from various historical sources.

73
00:04:42,737 --> 00:04:47,199
This project extends Koyama’s legacy far beyond her own lifetime,

74
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,620
and proves that science is not built solely on astounding discoveries,

75
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,541
but also on careful observation of the world around us.
