00:00:08,796 --> 00:00:12,300
The Trojan War has been raging for 10 years,

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,595
with neither Greeks nor Trojans prevailing.

3
00:00:15,595 --> 00:00:19,348
Gods and humans alike are desperate for a break,

4
00:00:19,348 --> 00:00:22,643
so when a divine omen races across the sky,

5
00:00:22,643 --> 00:00:26,814
the two sides agree to a 10 day truce.

6
00:00:26,814 --> 00:00:30,693
From high up on Olympus you’ve been waiting for an opportunity

7
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:33,404
to bring this bloody war to its conclusion.

8
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:36,824
When you go to consult the Fates, they advise:

9
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:42,371
should the peace last for a full 10 days, all will end soon.

10
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:45,625
However, if the truce is broken,

11
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:50,963
the ensuing battle will lead to 10 more devastating years of war.

12
00:00:51,756 --> 00:00:55,218
The Fates’ loom has shown them the exact conditions

13
00:00:55,218 --> 00:00:57,678
that will keep the truce intact.

14
00:00:57,678 --> 00:01:03,684
The great Trojan plain can be viewed as a grid of Greek and Trojan encampments.

15
00:01:03,684 --> 00:01:09,065
If they’re organized in such a way that any Greek can reach any other Greek camp

16
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:13,402
without having to pass through a Trojan camp, and likewise for Trojans,

17
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:18,241
plus neither side completely surrounds the other, peace will prevail.

18
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:22,787
Anyone can move to a horizontally or vertically adjacent camp,

19
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:24,413
but never diagonally.

20
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:28,459
The problem is, they’re currently arranged like this.

21
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:33,840
Tonight, you can use your powers to swap up to six pairs of camps

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,928
that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

23
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:42,098
No camp can be moved more than once.

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,893
Which swaps do you make to keep the peace?

25
00:01:45,893 --> 00:01:48,312
Pause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3

26
00:01:48,312 --> 00:01:50,606
Answer in 2

27
00:01:50,606 --> 00:01:53,109
Answer in 1

28
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:58,156
The first insight here is to divide this into two sub-problems.

29
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:01,409
There’s the matter of connecting 4 clumps of Greeks

30
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,703
without putting holes in the Trojan line.

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,707
And then there’s dealing with the thorny center space.

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,126
Let’s consider the Greeks first.

33
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:12,253
To connect any Greek clumps,

34
00:02:12,253 --> 00:02:15,715
you’ll have to mess with the nice, straight Trojan lines.

35
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:19,218
If you try to do that anywhere in the center of these arms,

36
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:22,722
you'll create new isolated clusters of Trojans.

37
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:26,726
So the only option is to go to the perimeter of the field

38
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:31,606
and move some Trojans diagonally, say here, here, and here.

39
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:33,566
Now for the center.

40
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:38,404
there’s no way to connect the Trojan arms without swapping a Trojan in.

41
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:42,450
But continuing to shift that arm of Trojans inward

42
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,662
would require moving the same Greek camp multiple times.

43
00:02:46,662 --> 00:02:52,251
However, you could shift the whole Trojan arm up and to the right,

44
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:53,836
closing this gap.

45
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:57,173
There are several solutions with slight variants,

46
00:02:57,173 --> 00:03:01,552
but as long as you perform this maneuver on the short arm of Trojans,

47
00:03:01,552 --> 00:03:05,097
you can achieve peace in exactly 6 moves.

48
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:09,268
You make the swaps and all is well until the fifth night.

49
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,314
One of your rival gods wants to see the bloodshed continue,

50
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:16,567
and has taken advantage of a forgotten prophecy.

51
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:20,613
He’s convinced one Trojan camp to make a swap

52
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:24,992
with their horizontal, vertical, or diagonal Greek neighbors

53
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:27,578
that will break up the Greek connectivity.

54
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:32,291
Once again, you consult the Fates, who prophesize the following:

55
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:36,712
the meddling Trojan camp is somewhere within four grid spaces

56
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:38,631
of the perimeter of the battlefield.

57
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:44,303
They won’t go through with a swap if it only breaks up Trojan connectivity.

58
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:49,100
And finally, you can make at most two swaps

59
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,061
with the same rules as before to thwart them.

60
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:56,649
Which swaps do you make to block the troublesome Trojan camp?

61
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:59,026
Answer in 3

62
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:01,362
Answer in 2

63
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:04,824
Answer in 1

64
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:08,869
You won't be able to identify the scheming camp precisely,

65
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:12,581
but there’s a lot you can do to at least narrow down the options.

66
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:16,127
They have to be somewhere in this area.

67
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:21,132
And they have to be able to block Greek camps from each other in a single swap.

68
00:04:21,716 --> 00:04:23,551
That doesn’t leave many options;

69
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:28,139
the only possible blockages are at the end of these two arms,

70
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,476
where a Trojan camp could plug a hole without opening a new one.

71
00:04:32,476 --> 00:04:36,188
So they must be in one of these four camps.

72
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:38,190
Let’s look at the right arm first.

73
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,111
There’s a threat here because this column has two Trojan camps.

74
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,698
If one moves to the right, the other will still be in place,

75
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:47,867
blocking Greeks from crossing.

76
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:53,372
so we can thwart them by moving either one a column left into this square.

77
00:04:53,372 --> 00:04:56,625
and the same principle applies to the bottom arm.

78
00:04:56,625 --> 00:05:00,629
Your effort maintains the peace for the final 5 days.

79
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:04,425
But it seems that a certain Greek general noticed what was happening

80
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:07,261
and left the Trojans a parting gift...
