1
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:11,288
You're traveling deep beneath the ocean's surface,

2
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:14,746
where faint lights flicker and toothy grins flash.

3
00:00:14,954 --> 00:00:17,538
You are now entering... the Twilight Zone.

4
00:00:18,246 --> 00:00:20,579
Your mission is to survive these depths

5
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:23,954
and journey to the surface after sundown to feed.

6
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:26,538
You may now pick your player.

7
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:28,829
Just kidding— you don’t have a choice.

8
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:30,496
You’re a hatchetfish.

9
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:33,579
And almost everything else is trying to eat you.

10
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:37,371
The tools at your disposal are a uniquely shaped body,

11
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,704
shiny scales, and glowing spots on your belly.

12
00:00:40,996 --> 00:00:43,787
You’re going to need a lot of skill and a little luck.

13
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:47,287
Your first challenge is to begin your upwards trek.

14
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,329
Your swim bladder allows you to precisely control your buoyancy.

15
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:54,121
Come nightfall, you slowly fill it up,

16
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:57,454
becoming less dense and rising towards the surface.

17
00:00:57,996 --> 00:01:02,121
You can’t swim fast, but your narrow build makes you maneuverable.

18
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:06,746
This is especially important since predators could spring out of the darkness

19
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:07,871
at any moment.

20
00:01:08,246 --> 00:01:11,496
In fact, a fangtooth is gliding beneath you.

21
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:15,454
It has the ocean’s biggest tooth-to-body size ratio.

22
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:18,413
Food is hard to come by in the Twilight Zone,

23
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:22,788
so predators have fearsome adaptations to make every attack count.

24
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:26,121
The fangtooth’s skin is ultra-black:

25
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:30,663
it reflects less than 0.5% of the light that hits it,

26
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:33,913
making this fish particularly hard to spot.

27
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:38,996
Fortunately, the bioluminescent organs lining your belly are regulated

28
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:43,454
to match the intensity and pattern of the faint light from the ocean’s surface.

29
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:47,204
This counter-illumination disguises your silhouette.

30
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:51,413
So when the fangtooth gazes upwards, you’re almost invisible.

31
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:54,204
A bright spot appears in the distance.

32
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:57,871
You go to check it out, but something’s looming in the darkness.

33
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:01,954
The light is a bioluminescent lure belonging to an anglerfish.

34
00:02:02,204 --> 00:02:05,163
You dart away before it quickly opens its jaws,

35
00:02:05,163 --> 00:02:08,204
sucking in a hapless fish that got too close.

36
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:10,996
Another narrow escape, but you’re nearly there.

37
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:15,413
Although more than 90% of deep-sea creatures are bioluminescent,

38
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:19,746
only one group produces the color red: dragonfishes.

39
00:02:19,746 --> 00:02:21,079
One of them is near.

40
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:24,496
Because red light is quickly absorbed by seawater,

41
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:27,663
most deep-sea inhabitants can’t see it.

42
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:31,829
The dragonfish emits red light from organs by its eyes,

43
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:35,996
using an invisible headlight to locate unsuspecting prey

44
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:38,329
that its scoops into its cavernous jaw.

45
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:39,996
You can’t see your enemy,

46
00:02:39,996 --> 00:02:44,663
but your silvery, mirror-like scales scatter and soften direct light,

47
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:45,954
keeping you hidden.

48
00:02:46,163 --> 00:02:50,079
After three close calls, you reach... the Photic Zone.

49
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:53,454
You’ve just participated in the world’s largest migration.

50
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:58,579
It takes place every night as trillions of organisms rise from the ocean’s depths

51
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:02,579
to enjoy the surface’s rich resources under the cover of darkness.

52
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:04,996
The payoff is huge.

53
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:09,663
Here, your light-sensitive eyes take in a buffet of small crustaceans

54
00:03:09,663 --> 00:03:11,829
and gelatinous zooplankton.

55
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:16,746
During the day, phytoplankton use sunlight to turn dissolved carbon dioxide

56
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:19,288
into energy and build their own cells.

57
00:03:19,454 --> 00:03:24,246
They become food for small grazers, forming the base of the food web,

58
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:28,163
which extends back down to the Twilight Zone— and beyond.

59
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:34,079
Organic matter generated up here— like bits of skin, poop, and dead animals—

60
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,788
eventually sinks or is transported in the stomachs of animals

61
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:39,871
returning from their nightly migrations.

62
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:44,454
These materials then feed the creatures below that don't migrate.

63
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:47,746
This ensures that some of the carbon from the atmosphere

64
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:51,371
is locked away in the ocean for hundreds of years to come.

65
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:55,829
That's why this process is known as the biological carbon pump.

66
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:59,788
Without it, there’d be much more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,

67
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:02,163
where it contributes to climate change.

68
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,329
Your avatar, the hatchetfish, is part of this crucial process.

69
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,329
Your first quest is complete,

70
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:12,621
but you must repeat this journey every night for the rest of your life.

71
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:16,746
As the sun rises, the surface becomes dangerous,

72
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:20,871
and you descend back into the shadows of the Twilight Zone.
